## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am Suraj, a graduate student at San Jose State University, pursuing a Masterâ€™s degree in Engineering Technology with a specialization in Applied Network Systems. Previously, I worked as a Software Engineer at Juniper Networks, where I focused on solution testing for a cloud-native routing product. I also gained experience in network security during my tenure as a trainee at Brigade Group in Bangalore. Currently, I am expanding my expertise by exploring generative AI tools, frameworks, and machine learning while working on innovative and engaging projects.
